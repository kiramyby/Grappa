## what is `Grappa` ?  
  
`Grappa` is a web frame what is a knockoff of `Gin`. The name of it   
comes from a kind of wine, just like the gin...

Actually, till now `Grappa` is just a copy of [gee-web](https://github.com/geektutu/7days-golang/tree/master/gee-web), a great project to *go* better.
  
## What can `Grappa` do ?  
I have to say that it is just a by-product during my learning period,  
so it only has some basic functions.  
  
1. Default engine and customize function setting  
2. Handling request and context  
3. Dynamic route base on the trie  
4. Some native middleware  
5. Template rendering  
  
## In the End  
I guess no one will use it.
So that's all.
